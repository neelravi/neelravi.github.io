	abstract = {The accurate prediction of band gaps and structural properties in periodic systems continues to be one of the central goals of electronic structure theory. However, band gaps obtained from popular exchange–correlation (XC) functionals (such as LDA and PBE) are severely underestimated partly due to the spurious self-interaction error (SIE) inherent to these functionals. In this work, we present a new formulation and implementation of Wannier function-derived Fermi–Löwdin (WFL) orbitals for correcting the SIE in periodic systems. Since our approach utilizes a variational minimization of the self-interaction energy with respect to the Wannier charge centers (WCC), it is computationally more efficient than the HSE hybrid functional and other self-interaction corrections that require a large number of transformation matrix elements. Calculations on several (17 in total) prototypical molecular solids, semiconductors, and wide-bandgap materials show that our WFL self-interaction correction approach gives better band gaps and bulk moduli compared to semilocal functionals, largely due to the partial removal of self-interaction errors.}

abstract = {Abstract We present a new assessment of the Fermi-Löwdin orbital self-interaction correction (FLO-SIC) approach with an emphasis on its performance for predicting energies as a function of fractional occupation numbers (FONs) for various multielectron systems. Our approach is implemented in the massively parallelized NWChem quantum chemistry software package and has been benchmarked on the prediction of total energies, atomization energies, and ionization potentials of small molecules and relatively large aromatic systems. Within our study, we also derive an alternate expression for the FLO-SIC energy gradient expressed in terms of gradients of the Fermi-orbital eigenvalues and revisit how the FLO-SIC methodology can be seen as a constrained unitary transformation of the canonical Kohn–Sham orbitals. Finally, we conclude with calculations of energies as a function of FONs using various SIC-scaling methods to test the limits of the FLO-SIC formalism on a variety of multielectron systems. We find that these relatively simple scaling methods do improve the prediction of total energies of atomic systems as well as enhance the accuracy of energies as a function of FONs for other multielectron chemical species.},

Using self-interaction-corrected Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations{,} we provide the first real-time assessment of PFAS degradation in the presence of excess electrons. In particular{,} we show that the initial phase of the degradation involves the transformation of an alkane-type C–C bond into an alkene-type CC bond in the PFAS molecule{,} which is initiated by the trans elimination of fluorine atoms bonded to these adjacent carbon atoms."}
