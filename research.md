The broad areas of research are theoretical and computational condensed matter physics. 
More specifically, following is the list of topics I have worked / am currently working: 

1. Improving the electronic structure calculation methods​  
2. Ab initio molecular dynamics​  				
3. Laser induced electron dynamics​  
4. Topologically nontrivial materials​  
5. Code development and scientific computing​  
6. Machine learning  
7. ab initio electronic structure calculations of clusters and extended systems​  
8. Optical absorption in clusters and solids​  
9. Energy storage materials​
