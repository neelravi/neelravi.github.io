title: About me
subtitle: A brief Introduction
---

I am currently working as a research scientist in the [TREX-CoE](https://trex-coe.eu) at the [University of Twente, the Netherlands](https://www.utwente.nl). My research focuses on achieving the Exascale computational performance for obtaining real chemical accuracy.

I received my M.Sc. -- Ph.D. dual degree in Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay). Then I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Universidad del Pais Vasco, Spain, Indian Institute of Science, and University of California Riverside, USA.

In my research, I combine atomistic modeling, both at the electronic (quantum) and atomic (classical) level, with machine learning methods. I am excited and passionate about developing new ways to solve novel problems in materials science and chemistry in silico in order to accelerate scientific discovery.
